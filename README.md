Front-end Assessment

## Time to Complete

With my full-time schedule I dedicated around 15hrs total across three evenings to complete the assessment. I unfortunately could not find a solution to the last feature.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- CSS
- REACT

## Challenges Included:

- Determining how to share state from where the tags were created ( bottom of my document tree) and with the "search by tag" input field.

- From my understanding, I needed to add a tags property to the student data object in order for my filter to work. I attempted to pass down the setStudent function as a prop down to the StudentProfile and use it to modify the student object but was unsuccessful.

## Lessons Learned

- This assignment gave me the opportunity to test my understanding of hooks and React in general.

- I have a long way to go but after this challenge I am eager to learn more state and hooks

- I will need to improve my understanding of how state is shared within an app and how to properly update it

### Thank you for your time and consideration! Kind regards, Irving
