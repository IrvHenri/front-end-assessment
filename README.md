Front-end take home assignment in which we had to replicate a studen database app. Objectives included: fetch API data , render data, implement controlled forms, and filtering across multiple criteria.  



## Tech Stack

- CSS
- REACT

## Challenges Included:

- Determining how to share state from where the tags were created ( bottom of my document tree) and with the "search by tag" input field.

- From my understanding, I needed to add a tags property to the student data object in order for my filter to work. I attempted to pass down the setStudent function as a prop down to the StudentProfile and use it to modify the student object but was unsuccessful.

- Positioning input field as fixed/sticky. Input field was overflowing from .App container. Input field was set to 100% but still overflowed.

## Lessons Learned

- This assignment gave me the opportunity to test my understanding of hooks and React in general.

- I have a long way to go but after this challenge I am eager to learn more state and hooks

- I will need to improve my understanding of how state is shared within an app and how to properly update it
